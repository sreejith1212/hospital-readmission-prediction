# Predicting Hospital Readmissions
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify patients who are at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days after their initial discharge.

## Pre-Requisite
1) Python: Install Python

## Installation
1) Clone the repo, create and activate the environment for the project.
2) Install all required packages from requirements.txt file using command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Usage
1) Run the notebook "hospital_readmission_predictor.ipynb" cells.
2) To start the app, run command: "streamlit run hospital_readmission_ui.py".
3) For patient readmission prediction, in the "Predict Hospital Readmission" page, input the required features and click on "Predict Readmission" button.

## Features
1) Setting up Streamlit App: Creating a user-friendly UI using Streamlit for predicting patient readmission to hospital.
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality and preparing it for analysis and model building.
3) Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
4) Model Building and Evaluation: Developing machine learning models to predict patients who are at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days after their initial discharge, and evaluating their performance.
5) Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance by fine-tuning model parameters for better predictions.
